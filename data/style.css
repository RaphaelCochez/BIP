-> this function can read all single page css but not multiple at the same time
-> we are short on local ram memory because of the local buffering of all the css files, html content, the logo.svg and config.json files
-> see memory leak image on github
-> thats why we need to add all css into one file and simplify it 
-> index.html can stay as is -> see result on github
